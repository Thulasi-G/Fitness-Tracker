🏋️‍♂️ Fitness Tracker Data Cleaning Project

📋 Project Overview :

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing raw fitness tracker data to make it ready for analysis.
The dataset includes information such as daily steps, calories burned, heart rate, and sleep patterns.
The main goal is to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and prepare the dataset for insights or visualization.

🎯 Objectives :

Identify and remove duplicate or inconsistent entries
Handle missing values appropriately
Standardize column names and data types
Detect and handle outliers (e.g., unrealistic step counts or heart rates)
Create a clean, analysis-ready dataset

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used :

Python
Pandas – for data manipulation
NumPy – for numerical operations
Matplotlib / Seaborn – for visual inspection
Jupyter Notebook – for interactive coding and visualization

📂 Dataset Description :

Source: (Mention your dataset source, e.g., Kaggle or Fitbit export)
Number of records: (e.g., 10,000 entries)
Key columns:
user_id
date
steps
calories
heart_rate
sleep_duration

🔧 Data Cleaning Steps :

Loaded dataset and checked basic info (.info(), .describe())
Removed duplicates
Handled missing values (e.g., mean/median imputation)
Converted data types (e.g., date column to datetime)
Renamed columns for consistency
Detected and removed outliers
Verified data quality after cleaning

📈 Future Work :

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Build predictive models (e.g., activity trends or calorie estimation)
Create dashboards for user activity insights

🧹 Mega Data Cleaning Project
📘 Overview

The Mega Data Cleaning Project focuses on preparing raw and unstructured data for further analysis and visualization.
This project demonstrates best practices in data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation using the dataset mega_data_cleaning_dataset.xlsx.

The goal is to ensure the dataset is accurate, consistent, and analysis-ready, which is an essential step in any data science or analytics workflow.

🎯 Objective

The main objectives of this project are to:

Identify and handle missing values – detect incomplete records and apply suitable imputation methods.

Remove duplicates – eliminate redundant entries to maintain dataset integrity.

Correct data formats and types – ensure numerical, categorical, and date columns have appropriate formats.

Detect and handle outliers – identify unusual data points that could affect analysis results.

Standardize text and categorical data – fix inconsistencies in naming, capitalization, and spacing.

Validate data integrity – cross-check relationships and ensure the data adheres to defined business rules.

Generate a clean, structured dataset – ready for use in analysis, machine learning, or visualization projects.

📂 Dataset

File Name: mega_data_cleaning_dataset.xlsx
Description:
A large, multi-sheet dataset containing raw business or customer data with inconsistent formats, missing values, and potential outliers — ideal for testing and demonstrating advanced data cleaning techniques.

🚀 Expected Outcomes

A fully cleaned and formatted version of the dataset.

Documented steps showing the entire cleaning workflow.

Summary statistics and validation of cleaned data quality.

💡 Future Enhancements

Automate cleaning pipelines using Python scripts.

Implement validation functions for dynamic data entry.

Integrate with visualization dashboards (e.g., Power BI, Tableau, or Plotly).

Add error logging and reporting for scalable use.
