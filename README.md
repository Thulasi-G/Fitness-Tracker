🏋️‍♂️ Fitness Tracker Data Cleaning Project

📋 Project Overview :

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing raw fitness tracker data to make it ready for analysis.
The dataset includes information such as daily steps, calories burned, heart rate, and sleep patterns.
The main goal is to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and prepare the dataset for insights or visualization.

🎯 Objectives :

Identify and remove duplicate or inconsistent entries
Handle missing values appropriately
Standardize column names and data types
Detect and handle outliers (e.g., unrealistic step counts or heart rates)
Create a clean, analysis-ready dataset

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used :

Python
Pandas – for data manipulation
NumPy – for numerical operations
Matplotlib / Seaborn – for visual inspection
Jupyter Notebook – for interactive coding and visualization

📂 Dataset Description :

Source: (Mention your dataset source, e.g., Kaggle or Fitbit export)
Number of records: (e.g., 10,000 entries)
Key columns:
user_id
date
steps
calories
heart_rate
sleep_duration

🔧 Data Cleaning Steps :

Loaded dataset and checked basic info (.info(), .describe())
Removed duplicates
Handled missing values (e.g., mean/median imputation)
Converted data types (e.g., date column to datetime)
Renamed columns for consistency
Detected and removed outliers
Verified data quality after cleaning

📈 Future Work :

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Build predictive models (e.g., activity trends or calorie estimation)
Create dashboards for user activity insights
